# Online-Shoping-Cart-system-console-base-C-Language

1. Introduction:
The C-based Online Shopping Cart System is a command-line application meant to fill the gap between offline
sales and online ease for small enterprises. As an
educational project, it illustrates how fundamental C
programming principles—such as file handling,
structures, and dynamic memory can generate
functional applications. In contrast to internet-dependent web-based systems, this minimalistic solution
runs offline, hence suitable for local traders with minimal
technical facilities.
Existing market statistics show that 68% of small stores
continue to use manual record-keeping (Retail Tech
Report, 2023), causing inventory mistakes and lost sales.
This solution solves these issues by offering:
 The project has two purposes: as an educational
platform for learning C programming basics and an
affordable digital improvement tool for microenterprises. Its modularity enables future extension
With the addition of GUI interfaces (through GTK) or
multi-user support.

2. Problem Statement:
Many students often struggle with:
1. Applying theoretical concepts to real projects
2. Understanding program flow in complete systems
3. Managing data without databases
4. Creating interactive menus with user input
5. Our solution provides:
✔ Hands-on experience with arrays, structures, and functions
✔ Visual program flow through simple algorithms
✔ File-based data persistence (optional)
✔ Menu-driven interface for better UX


3. Algorithms And Flowchart:
START
 │
 ├─ Initialize product data
 │
 ├─ Display main menu:
 │ 1. View Products
 │ 2. View Cart
 │ 3. Add to Cart

 │ 5. Checkout
 │ 6. Exit
 ├─ Process selection:
 │ - Switch-case structure
 │ - Function calls
 │
 └─ Repeat until Exit
